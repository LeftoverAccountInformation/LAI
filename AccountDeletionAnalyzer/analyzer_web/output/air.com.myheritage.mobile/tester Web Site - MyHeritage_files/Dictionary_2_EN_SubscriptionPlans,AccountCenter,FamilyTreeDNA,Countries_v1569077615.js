MyHeritage chose to partner with Family Tree DNA in order to provide its customers with the highest quality DNA testing available on the market.","FAQ A10":"DNA tests can be used by genealogists to:<br><ul><br><li>Link specific individuals - e.g. test to see whether you and a person you think may be genetic cousins descending from a common ancestor. <\/li><br><li>Prove or disprove the ancestry of people sharing the same last name - e.g. test to see if males carrying the TAYLOR surname are related to each other.<\/li><br><li>Map the genetic origins of large population groups - e.g. test to see whether you have European, Native American, Jewish or African American ancestry among others<\/li><br><li>Find other people who are related to you through the same male ancestor (Y-DNA), female ancestor (mtDNA) or across all lines (Family Finder), and to discover your ancestral origins. <\/li><br><\/ul>","FAQ A11":"The number of matches varies according to the frequency of your Haplotype in the database. Given the size of the database, most people will have matches. However, initially having a small number of matches or no matches at all, should not be a source of frustration, as the process does not end once the test is completed and the results posted. As the database keeps growing, you will be matched against the new records and notified when there is a match. This is a service Family Tree DNA provides with no subscription or other fees.","FAQ A12":"Family Tree DNA has created two public databases for people that wish to share or compare their results with other individuals or other labs: Ysearch.org and MitoSearch.org. Your results can be exported to those websites at your discretion.","FAQ A13":"No. Family Tree DNA or MyHeritage will never share your results. This includes insurance firms, employers and government agencies. In addition, in 2008, the GINA Act passed in the United States (Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act). The GINA Act stops insurance firms from using DNA test results to deny coverage.","FAQ A14":"Taking the DNA test is quick and easy. You take the test, which shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, at the comfort and privacy of your home. The test kit consists of two swabs, two tubes, instructions, and the release form. At the test, you will rub the swab on the inside of your cheek, and place it in the tube.<br><br>%1 to see what the DNA test looks like.<br><br>%2 an instructional video of How to Take Our DNA Test.","FAQ A15":"The amount of time varies according to the test kit you order. The average time from receiving your kit at Family Tree DNA until they post your results is six weeks. We'll continue to update you about new matches and other information regarding your results.","FAQ A16":"DNA tests are less expensive than one would think. With costs starting at %1 a DNA test can provide a genealogist with an answer that otherwise would take years to find, numerous trips and fees for other services. There are many testimonials from genealogists that after years of research found their answers in a simple DNA test.","FAQ A17":"When you order a DNA test, Family Tree DNA creates a personal page for you, password protected, where your results are posted. From that page you can print reports and your certificate. After your initial results, you keep receiving updated information about your matches, and as they happen, you are informed by email.","FAQ A18":"Certainly. In your personal page at Family Tree DNA you will receive the names and email addresses of your matches so that you can exchange information with them. It is important to know that for privacy reasons, you will only see the names and emails of those individuals with whom you show a relevant match, as described in the DNA tests privacy policy.","FAQ A19":"Some tests are based on the DNA that is passed from father to son; others are based on DNA passed from mother to her children, male or female. This is why certain tests are suitable only for males as clearly documented on the website. However, if you are a female genealogist and you want to test the paternal line, you can purchase a DNA test for your brother or father to use. In addition, if your spouse is also as interested in family history as you, you can purchase a DNA test for your spouse in order to assist them with their family history research.","FAQ A2":"The tests are made by Family Tree DNA.","FAQ A20":"DNA for genealogy is pushing the frontiers of science, and different tests are offered to meet different research objectives of our users. Depending on your goals, you can focus on your maternal line, your paternal line, your ethnic origin, or on finding relatives from all lines. The Comprehensive Genome test combines the best of everything to give you the most extensive results across the board. You can also start with a highly affordable entry-level test like the Y-DNA37 and later on upgrade to a test with higher resolution and accuracy like the Y-DNA67.","FAQ A21":"The Chromosome has definable segments of DNA with known genetic characteristics. These segments are known as Markers.<br><br>If you are using the MyHeritage Family Tree Builder software, you can enter the DNA marker information for future reference by editing an individual who was tested, then going to the \u201cMore\u201d tab, clicking \u201cDNA Markers...\u201d button, selecting \u201cFamily Tree DNA\u201d and entering the marker results.

This includes insurance firms. In addition, in 2008, the GINA Act passed in the United States. The GINA Act stops insurance firms from using DNA test results to deny coverage.","FAQ A9":"There are two basic types of DNA tests available for genealogical testing:<br><br><b>mtDNA Tests<\/b> - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is contained in the cytoplasm of the cell, rather than the nucleus. This type of DNA is passed by a mother to both male and female offspring without any mixing, so your mtDNA is the same as your mother's mtDNA, which is the same as her mother's mtDNA. mtDNA changes very slowly so it cannot determine close relationships as well as it can determine general relatedness. If two people have an exact match in their mtDNA, then they share a common maternal ancestor, but it is hard to determine if this is a recent ancestor or one who lived hundreds of years ago. It is important to keep in mind with this test that a male's mtDNA comes only from his mother and is not passed on to his offspring.<br><br>Example: The DNA tests that identified the bodies of the Romanovs, the Russian imperial family, utilized mtDNA from a sample provided by Prince Philip, who shares the same maternal line from Queen Victoria.<br><br><b>Y-DNA Tests<\/b> - The Y chromosome in the nuclear DNA is used to establish family ties. The Y chromosomal DNA test (usually referred to as Y-DNA) is only available for males, since the Y chromosome is only passed down the male line from father to son. Tiny chemical markers on the Y chromosome create a distinctive pattern, known as a haplotype, that distinguishes one male lineage from another. Shared markers can indicate relatedness between two men, though not the exact degree of the relationship. Y chromosome testing is most often used by individuals with the same last name to learn if they share a common ancestor, however, it is also used to verify if two males share the same paternal ancestor, no matter how many generations back, even if they have different surnames.","FAQ Q1":"Who is Family Tree DNA and why have you partnered with them?","FAQ Q10":"What kind of information can I learn from a DNA test?","FAQ Q11":"How many DNA matches can I expect to receive?","FAQ Q12":"Can I export my DNA results?","FAQ Q13":"Is taking a DNA test going to risk my privacy?","FAQ Q14":"How easy is it to take a DNA test?","FAQ Q15":"How long does it take before I get my results?","FAQ Q16":"Are the tests expensive?","FAQ Q17":"What is the format in which the results arrive?","FAQ Q18":"Will I be able to contact my DNA matches (people who may have the same ancestors as me)?","FAQ Q19":"I see that you have some tests for males and some for females.
