Loved by People Around the World
Inkitt redefined my life and could do the same to yours. They aren’t a publishing house, they are a family. And family doesn’t give up on family. So I can guarantee you, when you become a family member. You will be shown the unending support I have been given.

It is a major encouragement to writers, it gives everyone a chance to reach a wider audience and provides an amazing support system to help writers grow.

It gives me a chance to check out up and coming authors and read works ahead of publishing. Great way to discover an author who will one day be renowned.
